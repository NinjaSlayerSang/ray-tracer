# Learning Project

This is a project for studying Ray Tracing algorithm & Rust language, refering to [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) but implemented by Rust.

# Ray Tracing

An excellent series of primer tutorial books for this fascinating Computer Graphics technology: [Ray Tracing in One Weekend â€” The Book Series](https://raytracing.github.io/)

# Multiple Threads

Render rays' color in mutiple threads, only invloving Rust standard library.
Learn how to use **std::sync::Arc** sharing pointers among threads, **std::sync::mpsc::channel** sending messages between threads, and **std::sync::Mutex** & **std::sync::Condvar** implementing a *Semaphore* to control the amount of active threads.

# Run

Install Rust toolchain before running.

```shell
# main
cargo run --release -- image.ppm
# add "--release" unless you have enough patience to wait for much longer time...

# test
cargo test --test ${test_crate_name} -- --color always --show-output
```
