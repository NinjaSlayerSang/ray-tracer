# Learning Project

This is a project for studying **Ray Tracing** algorithm & **Rust** language, refering to [*Ray Tracing in One Weekend*](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) but implemented by Rust.

# Ray Tracing

An excellent series of primer tutorial books for this fascinating Computer Graphics technology: [*Ray Tracing in One Weekend â€” The Book Series*](https://raytracing.github.io/)

# Multiple Threads

Render rays' color in multiple threads, only invloving Rust standard library.
Learn how to use **_std::sync::Arc_** sharing pointers among threads, **_std::sync::mpsc::channel_** sending messages between threads, and **_std::sync::Mutex_** & **_std::sync::Condvar_** implementing a **_Semaphore_** to control the amount of active threads.

# Run

Install **_Rust toolchain_** before running.

```shell
# pinballs
cargo run --example pinballs --release -- pinballs.ppm
# marble texture
cargo run --example marble --release -- marble.ppm
# add "--release" unless you have enough patience to wait for much longer time...

# test
cargo test --test ${test_crate_name} -- --color always --show-output
```
